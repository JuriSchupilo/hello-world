Each cleared box yields a score-unit (in Score Rush) or a time-unit (in Extend Time). 
Obtained time-units are added to the battery time.
Use streaks to multiply recently obtained score/time-units by the streak number.

"In Score Rush Mode, each cleared box yields points.
In Extend Time, each cleared box yields additional battery charge.
Use streaks to multiply obtained score/charge by the streak number."
